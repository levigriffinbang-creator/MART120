The difference between GUI and CLI is GUI is the interacting with the computer through the desktop directory. You can only interact with the folders that are already set up, which requires either searching for them through the OS’s search feature, and/or staying organized. CLI allows for more direct control over what’s going on by inputting commands directly, and being able to make widespread, direct changes to how the computer runs with code.
