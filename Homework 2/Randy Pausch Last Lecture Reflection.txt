I thought it was admirable that he was able to look back on his life in a positive light. I think it can be easy to be pessimistic and hard on yourself, especially in a bigger picture sense. He had a pretty eventful life to be fair, being able to go into zero gravity and work in VR in lots of different ways, so I can’t really relate to that part, but I think he had a lot of good advice. 
        Making yourself “useful” to others to be able to achieve stuff you want to, or “bringing something to the table” as he says I think is really interesting advice. It makes a lot of sense logistically but I don’t know if I’ve ever thought of it exactly like how he puts it. Developing a specific skillset to achieve one thing is kind of how I’ve thought about how I’m living my life, but being open minded to different situations to apply those skills makes sense in how to try and achieve all you want to. The idea of being “useful” being more important than having any given specific skillset is something I want to try and embody more. 
        He puts a lot of importance in criticism as well, which I think is important. If no one is being hard on you, it means no one cares enough to make sure you’re doing good is an idea he brings up in regards to his coach. I think being able to recognize when you’re doing something wrong is good, be that from a teacher or peers, which he also brings up in the peer reviews his students would do. The idea of stagnating and not knowing kind of scares me.
