I think it makes a lot of sense that no given person would have one specific way they learn best. The best way to learn being to spread out study lessons, engage with the material in different ways and synthesize the material with outside information makes sense since its one, forcing you to steep in the material, and two, its potentially using multiple areas of your brain to engage with it. I’ve generally always thought of myself as a more visual learner, but then unless I actually have to do whatever it is that I’m trying to learn, I won’t be able to remember what I just learned long-term. I think the idea of learning by incorporating material from outside what you’re directly studying is really interesting too.
